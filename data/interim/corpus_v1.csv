In creative education, determining how students can benefit without becoming dependent on them is a challenge. In this study, researchers conducted an exploratory experiment that positioned AI as a relational artifact to students in a series of drawing activities and examined the potential impact of affective relations with machines in socio-cultural creative learning. The resulting artifacts, observations, and interview transcripts were analyzed using the Consensual Assessment Technique and a grounded theory approach. The study's results indicate that the design professors reliably evaluated the student drawings as more creative than the AI drawings, but neither demonstrated a consistent increase in creativity. However, the presence of AI engaged the students to explore different approaches to artistic prompts. We theorize that AI can be mediated as a learning artifact for transformative creativity if the students perceive their relationship with AI as empathetic and collaborative.","Relational artifact, Creative learning, Computational creativity, Sociocultural creativity, Artificial intelligence",Semantic Scholar,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14626268.2023.2236595 ,10/25/2025,Creative Learning,Finland,

Tie, Chundong Shi",Journal of Education and Social Research,2023,"Creativity should be seen as a critical skill for students in the twenty-first century and a stated objective of formal education that supports students in navigating an ambiguous future. There is evidence that a creative learning environment would encourage students to be more creative in the classroom, but research is lacking to support this. This study examines whether a creative learning environment will encourage students to be more creative in three ways: learning goal orientation, network links, and knowledge sharing, based on Amabile's componential theory of creativity. A total of 388 Chinese university students participated in the surveys. The collected data were analysed by SmartPLS 4, the approach of multiple mediation analysis. The results demonstrate that a creative learning environment makes students more focused on learning goals and more willing to share information, significantly positively affecting student creativity. However, network ties do not play a role in the link between a creative learning environment and student creativity. In the end, this study discusses the theoretical and educational implications of the results, the drawbacks of the study, and recommendations for future studies.","Learning Goal Orientation, Knowledge Sharing, Network Ties, Creative Learning Environment, Student Creativity",Semantic Scholar,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-Empirical-Study-on-the-Creative-Learning-Student-Wang-Tie/ca209110e95f5c94408e8094de7287e24b9dd429 ,10/25/2025,Creative Learning,Malaysia,

Hayhoe",Education for Primary Care,2024,"Reflective practice is fundamental to postgraduate general practitioner (GP) training and ongoing professional development. However, real-world challenges like time constraints and professional isolation often limit meaningful engagement with this critical skill. This article proposes that large language models (LLMs), sophisticated artificial intelligence systems, may have potential for enhancing reflective practice. We present three case studies, in which we explore the ability of LLMs to generate thought-provoking questions, which could prompt GPs to consider new angles, address underlying factors, and bridge the gap between theory and practice. Our findings suggest that LLMs could help reframe experiences and foster deeper self reflection, particularly for isolated practitioners. While ethical concerns regarding privacy, over reliance, and potential biases exist, we consider the possibility of responsibly integrating LLMs into reflective practice. For trainees, AI-generated questions might complement personal reflection under guidance. For GPs working in isolation, LLMs present an opportunity to enhance reflective practice, challenging us to consider a place for this technological innovation without diminishing the human aspects essential to medical practice.","Artificial intelligence, Natural language processing, Cognitive reflection, Education, Medical-General practice",Semantic Scholar,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14739879.2024.2372606 ,10/26/2025,Reflective Practice,United Kingdom,

Ng",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2022,"Purpose While research is beginning to reveal the potential of dialogue in sparking critical reflection (critically reflective ways of seeing), additional research is needed to guide the teaching of critical reflection toward enabling critically reflective practice (critically reflective ways of seeing and doing). An experimental study was conducted to investigate the impact of dialogic learning on critically reflective practice, compared to discussion-based learning. The dialogic intervention integrated the theory of Mikhail Bakhtin with the theory of critical reflection and critical disability studies. Method In interprofessional groups of 4, medical, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology students were randomly assigned to a learning condition that used a reflective discussion or critically reflective dialogue about a pediatric patient case. All participants were then randomly assigned a clinical report for a novel pediatric patient and asked to write a hypothetical clinical letter to the child’s school. Hierarchical logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the probabilities of sentences and letters being critically reflective. Results The probability of sentences being critically reflective was significantly higher for the dialogue condition (0.26, 95% CI [0.2, 0.33]), compared to the discussion condition (0.11, 95% CI [0.07, 0.15]). Likewise, the probability of letters being critically reflective was significantly higher for the dialogue condition (0.26, 95% CI [0.15, 0.4]), compared to the discussion condition (0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.16]). In both conditions, the probability of a letter being critically reflective was positively associated with the proportion of critically reflective sentences. Conclusions The results demonstrate dialogic learning prepared students to enact critically reflective practice when writing mock clinical letters. Students who participated in a dialogue engaged in a collaborative process of critical reflection and subsequently applied that way of seeing in the individual act of writing a letter.

This paper focuses on the informal STEM (science, technology, engineering, and maths) learning sector, where there is an acute shortage of support for critical reflective practice despite long-standing, entrenched issues of inequity. We analyse how practitioners used a new reflective tool, the Equity Compass, co-developed by researchers and practitioners through a five-year partnership. We report on multimodal qualitative data (interviews, ethnographic observations, group discussions, partner site visits, and workshops) from 12 practitioners in four settings in the UK: a community zoo, regional science centre, digital arts centre and an initiative supporting girls and non-binary young people into STEM. We discuss how using the Equity Compass: (i) increased and deepened practitioners’ knowledge and understanding of equity issues; (ii) supported personal and institutional critical reflection, helping practitioners move beyond ‘gut instinct’ to interrogate their own positionality, ask new questions, and critically evaluate the effectiveness of attempts at inclusive practice; and (iii) fostered more intentional equitable planning and practice, such as participatory approaches that shared authority with learners and introduced more inclusive forms of representation.

Forsey,  Naomi Steenhof",Advances in Health Sciences Education,2022,"Adaptive expertise (AE) and reflective practice (RP), two influential and resonant theories of professional expertise and practice in their own right, may further benefit health professions education if carefully combined. The current societal and systemic context is primed for both AE and RP. Both bodies of work position practitioners as agentive, learning continually and thoughtfully throughout their careers, particularly in order to manage unprecedented situations well. Similar on the surface, the roots and practices of AE and RP diverge at key junctures and we will focus on RP’s movement toward critically reflective practice. The roots of AE and RP, and how they relate to or diverge from present-day applications matter because in health professions education, as in all education, paradigmatic mixing should be undertaken purposefully. This paper will explore the need for AE and RP, their shared commitments, distinctive histories, pedagogical possibilities both individually and combined, and next steps for maximizing their potential to positively impact the field. We argue that this exploration is urgently needed because both AE and RP hold much promise for improving health care and yet employing them optimally—whether alone or together—requires understanding and intent. We build an interprofessional education case situated in long-term care, throughout the paper, to demonstrate the potential that AE and RP might offer to health professions education individually and combined. This exploration comes just in time. Within the realities of uncertain practice emphasized by the pandemic, practitioners were also called to act in response to complex and urgent social movements.

Therefore, Precedent-based instruction is the most effective teaching method in an Architectural design studio. This study has identified a few frequent errors when performing precedent studies, i.e., romanticizing decisions in Precedent Studies, neglecting Context, and shallow appreciation without a systematic way. This study offers potential for further research to devise an appropriate tool to conduct an analytical study of precedents to avoid falsification and non-contextual solutions.","Precedent Study, Architecture Studio, Context, Falsification",Semantic Scholar,https://www.gesrjournal.com/article/precedent-study-an-approach-to-learning-about-design-challenges-in-architectural-studio-pedagogy ,10/28/2025,Studio Pedagogy,Pakistan,

The first step of the study was to reframe the assignment briefs as design problems and student design works as design solutions. The outcomes of the identification were further used as input data to generate synthetic design solutions by text-to-image diffusion models. In the third step, the design solution sets generated by students and the diffusion models were comparatively assessed by design experts with regards to how well they answered to the design problems defined in the briefs. The initial findings showed that diffusion models were able to generate a myriad of design solutions in a short time. It is conjectured that this might help students to easily understand the ill-defined design problem requirements and generate visual concepts based on written descriptions.

42,251073097,Uncovering inclusivity gaps in design pedagogy through the digital design marginalization framework,"Jaisie Sin, Cosmin Munteanu, S. Szigeti",Frontiers of Computer Science,2022,"Designers play a key role in the design of inclusive and socially conscious interfaces. Thus, it is imperative for designers to be thoughtful of the ethical and social implications of design. However, gaps in the foundational training that designers receive (e.g., as university students) can negatively impact their ability to consider the social implications of their design practice. This can result in consequences such as digital marginalization, which, as defined by the Digital Design Marginalization (DDM) framework, is the “pushing away”, whether intentional or not, of a defined group of users from a digital or online service or system, where the exclusion has additional, indirect, and long-lasting social consequences on that particular user group. Designers can contribute, even unintentionally, to digital marginalization through their design practices and the design choices they make. We argue that our role as educators includes ensuring not only that our design pedagogy is inclusive, but that the designers we train now are prepared to conduct their future design practice in a manner that is inclusive to all users. As such, we propose to use the Digital Design Marginalization as a lens to guide a reflection-based approach to identify gaps in our pedagogy that may lead to designers becoming ill-equipped to identify how their designs may lead to digital marginalization. Through seven case studies from our own teaching practice, we demonstrate the use of the DDM framework to guide marginalization-focused introspective reflections of curricula. These reflections through the DDM lens revealed gaps in our pedagogy with respect to providing future designers with training that enables them to consider the broader societal and individual implications of the design choices they will make in future practice. Based on our experience using the DDM framework, we then discuss in greater depth how reflection of social consequences of design pedagogy can be operationalized within institutions to reduce educational gaps that may be associated with design-mediated digital marginalization. Finally, we comment on avenues for further development of pedagogical reflection using DDM.","Design, Pedagogy, Digital Design, Framework",Semantic Scholar,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computer-science/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2022.822090/full ,10/30/2025,Design Pedagogy,Canada,

Price",Desing and Technology Education,2020,"HCI and Industrial Design are both disciplines that are currently experiencing radical transformation in terms of their identity and scope. HCI has moved beyond its origins in human factors and cognitive psychology towards the proactive and generative design of experience. Industrial Design has similarly evolved from a concern with physical form and function-giving solutions to the holistic design considerations of the user’s experience. Given the complexity and scale of this shifting design landscape, the response of design education must shift in methods and learning and teaching objectives. This paper provides the Design and Technology Education community with a research case study of innovation within HCI education, here situated within the broader context of Industrial Design education. We present a novel pedagogy for designing digital touch communications, developed through an interdisciplinary collaboration of HCI, Industrial Design, and Social Science academics, and advanced through a coursework assignment for 64 undergraduate Industrial Design and Technology students undertaking a User-Experience Design module at the [AUTHOR] (UK). We discuss the role of low-fidelity experience prototyping of digital touch interactions beyond screens, and the limitations of such an approach when engaged with by novice designers with entrenched material science understanding. We conclude the paper with a call for new educational ‘tools’ to support and scaffold both the learning and teaching of design for digital touch experiences within a User-Experience Design context, and we offer our development of a Designing Digital Touch Toolkit as one such tool.","digital touch, HCI, experience prototype, design pedagogy, user experience, multidisciplinary ",Semantic Scholar,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Digital-Touch%3A-Towards-a-Novel-User-Experience-Mitchell-Wilson/8ee25d6a76c18b243d1f1db4ab9536ecae319fd3 ,10/30/2025,Design Pedagogy,United Kingdom,

Kakarountas",Information,2022,"Digital Design is a laboratory course, and the educator must focus on the students’ need to know why they study the theory and mainly on the transition from knowledge-based learning to competency-based learning. This study consists of five surveys that were conducted during 2017–2021. First, we evaluated students’ learning outcomes in order to define possible learning problems. According to the literature, gamification can have a positive impact on students’ motivation and learning outcomes. Therefore, we used ready-made digital games in order to evaluate students’ satisfaction and willingness toward their integration in the educational process. This process was repeated in the next academic year. The feedback we received from the previous surveys has helped us to adapt to the new approaches of teaching due to the current pandemic caused by COVID-19. We proposed an online holistic environment based on Keller’s (1987) ARCS model and Malone’s (1981) motivational model, which was applied in distance learning. Each student participated in a student-centered learning experience. He took an active role and was self-manager of his learning process. He was given the opportunity to develop capabilities and strategies through practice and engagement in higher-order cognitive activities, acquire self-learning skills, learn how to solve problems, and participate in teamwork. This study’s innovation is that students experienced a combination of learning approaches: (a) a virtual lab consisting of simulation-based activities, which allowed students to access new laboratory experiences, (b) a project-based digital game without a processor, which developed their motivation, creativity, and hands-on ability, as opposed to the other relevant studies that use ready-made games, and (c) asynchronous videos as feedback, which ensured the educator’s emotional support and social presence. Finally, this study developed research to evaluate the effectiveness of this online holistic environment and used a questionnaire, which was created based on Keller’s Instructional Materials Motivation Survey tool. The results showed that its integration in distance learning is probable to motivate students to learn and affect positively their attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction.","distance education and online learning, games, simulations, media in education, post-secondary education",Semantic Scholar,https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/13/4/177 ,11/1/2025,Digital Design,Greece,

One of the main responsibilities of architectural education is to educate students on the breadth of professional opportunities and career paths. Therefore, it is highly important to examine the sufficiency of available digital design courses in the architectural education curriculum. To achieve this, the study examines the curriculum of two architectural programs in the Middle East and compares the findings with award-winning architectural firms in international professional practice from a digital design perspective. In the first step, various cutting-edge technology-driven firms were investigated, then three award-winning firms were subsequently selected and studied using a deliberate review. Secondly, the curriculum of each architecture school was reviewed and the responsible instructors were interviewed through a qualitative method of in-depth interviews; the perceptions and suggestions of eight academic staff members from both schools (four each) were recorded to facilitate an assessment of the status of the integrated digital design methodologies in the architecture education of the intended schools. The findings indicate that the current structures of architecture education curricula cannot match the innovative challenges and social demands of architecture in the digital age.

However, introducing AI presents an opportunityto expand the pedagogical scope, enabling students to engage with emerging concepts and techniques. A Design/ Research studio, titled “The Sacred in Between: Architectural Explorations of Sacred Spaces,” enabled students in exploringthe concept of “the sacred” through digital and physical artifacts, employing AI as a novel tool. Utilizing Midjourney AI,students synthesized relevant readings and discussions to create imagined scenes, with an extensive array of imagesaiding the initial design process. Additionally, reflections on encounters with AI spurred a class debate on AI’s influence on architectural education and the profession.A core discussion emerged around the potential decrease in human agency and creativity due to an overreliance onAI, which may lead to a standardized design approach, thus inhibiting individual expression and innovation. The ethical dimension of integrating AI into the curriculum was also explored, with concerns regarding authorship.

This paper examines the implications of genAI as a transformative technology on the development of future designers, focusing on its potential impact on essential cognitive processes, particularly heteromorphic imagination. We argue that the uncritical adoption of genAI in design education may inadvertently alter the free flow of imaginative thought, which is crucial for innovative and original design solutions. GenAI, while revolutionizing the production of prototypes and visualizations, may influence designers to focus prematurely on concrete outcomes, potentially bypassing the exploratory stage of heteromorphic imagination. This fluid, non-linear phase of ideation is fundamental to the development of diverse, innovative concepts and is intrinsically linked to the phenomenological experience of the creative process. The paper addresses concerns about the potential homogenization of ideas, the impact on cognitive development traditionally fostered through exploratory, experimental, and hands-on learning experiences, and the industry's promotion of AI integration in education despite a lack of established methodologies. We also highlight critical ethical concerns, including the use of machine learning models trained on artists' work without explicit permission, and the substantial carbon footprint associated with AI systems. These ethical considerations add complexity to the educational challenge of integrating genAI responsibly. In response, we propose that design education must evolve to nurture heteromorphic imagination while thoughtfully integrating genAI as a transformative technology. This approach involves developing new pedagogical strategies that emphasize open-ended exploration, embrace ambiguity, and cultivate the unique aspects of human creativity, while also addressing ethical and environmental concerns. By confronting these challenges, we aim to contribute to the development of designers who can harness the transformative power of AI while maintaining the essential human aspects of creative thinking and ethical consideration necessary for innovative and responsible design in the 21st century.","Design education, Generative AI, Creativity, Pedagogical strategies, Ideation, Heteromorphic imagination.",Semantic Scholar,https://library.iated.org/view/BALKHYOOR2024MAC ,11/2/2025,AI in Design Education,United States,

To provide an overview of technology-enhanced learning in higher education, we conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines of digital innovations in learning designs between 2014 and 2019, prior to emergency remote teaching responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. From 130 publications, we identified eight overlapping categories of digital technologies being deployed across higher education fields: simulation and augmented or virtual reality; Web 2.0; learning management systems; mobile learning; gamification and serious games; various technologies in classrooms; massive open online courses; and other software, websites, applications and cloud computing. We use these publications, supplemented with findings from selected meta-analyses and systematic reviews of specific technologies, as examples to guide educators designing technology-enhanced learning activities in changing circumstances that may require blended or fully online delivery. As the 130 publications had mixed perceived quality, levels of evidence and details of learning designs and evaluation presented, we suggest educators share their innovations following reporting guidelines relevant to their research methodologies, enabling others to consider transferability to other contexts and to build on their work. Implications for practice or policy: Leaders and administrators should support staff development of technological pedagogical content knowledge and teaching as design for student learning. Educators and instructional designers, in designing learning experiences, should consider adult learning theories, inclusive practices and digital equity and leverage multiple technologies to facilitate students learning their curricula.

Accordingly, this paper presents a cross-domain literature review on the topic. The findings of the review have led to a discussion on guest speakers in design studios as an effective manifestation of inquiry-based learning (IBL). By searching 8 databases using the PICO framework, a systematic literature review was conducted to an in-depth examination of 35 articles across 25 domains in higher education, followed by a thematic analysis considering Braun and Clarke’s approach. The interpretive analysis yielded six themes: (1) bridging academia and practice, (2) speaker selection, (3) event planning, (4) content and format, (5) interaction mode, and (6) students’ preferences. While incorporating guest speakers can enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and networking, successful implementation hinges on addressing several factors such as the role of instructors’ guidance and tailoring topics and guest speakers’ selection with students' levels. Students' engagement with guest speakers in exploring content, issues, real-world perspectives and questions aligns with experiential learning and IBL principles. The study underscores the need for additional research in architecture education to understand students’ and instructors’ perceptions, concerning the role of guest speakers particularly on issues like contributions to learning, influence on design approaches and the implications for developing collaborative pedagogical practices.

The sudden shift from on-site teaching to online distance learning offered the possibility to examine new settings of the studio, a core element of planning and architecture education. Although the pandemic is now over, online learning has secured a fixed place in university education, and consequently, educational institutions need to reconsider studio education based on the lessons learned during the pandemic. Through studying four studios taught at Aalto University, Finland, in 2020 and 2021, this article examines student-teacher experiences, and proposes opportunities for evolving studio education. The findings show that distance learning has in general sustained the objectives of studio education. However, challenges remain especially regarding the social aspects of learning. The degree of success of online teaching varied greatly depending on the tasks and the orientation of the studio (design or strategy). Technological aids and devices also had an influence on fulfilling the pedagogical objectives of learning. Professional socialization was highly affected by the online environment both in design and planning studios and the architectural representation witnessed difficulties specifically in design studios. To evolve the studio setting, the article suggests a mixed modality model supporting the social dimension of studio teaching by combining on-site and online learning activities to enrich the learning process.

Erdem",Trends in Higher Education,2024,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online studio education, which has presented a significant challenge to traditional design studio teaching methods that rely on face-to-face interactions between instructors and students. It is contended that online studio education enhances the accessibility of design studio pedagogy, making it possible for students to learn from anywhere in the world. However, it also challenges the development of tactile skills, which are crucial in design education. Additionally, online studio education can render certain aspects of traditional design studio pedagogy obsolete, while bringing back elements of design history and theory that may have been overlooked in traditional studio teaching. It can also be argued that online studio education has the potential to reverse the traditional power dynamics between instructors and students, resulting in more democratic and collaborative forms of learning that can empower students. As the literature on the effects of online studio education is growing, there is a need to understand how the shift from the material space and its affordances to an online environment affects the core components of an architectural design studio. To understand the effects of this new medium, this research employed Marshall McLuhan’s tetradic approach, a hermeneutic tool to perform a critical interpretation of any medium by examining four simultaneous effects: how it enhances a human sense, what it makes obsolete, what forgotten aspect it retrieves, and how it flips into its opposite at its extremes. A literature review was conducted to analyze the effects of online studios from a tetradic framework and identify the major discussions of the impact of online studio education. The methodology involves a two-part literature review. This study specifically focused on peer-reviewed, empirical research published after 2020, and the authors used search terms related to online architectural studios during the pandemic. The process identified 176 records of peer-reviewed empirical studies for further analysis and 20 papers were read and included in the review, defining repeating topics/themes and organized under four categories pertaining to the founding archetypes of an architectural design studio: (a) setting and communication, (b) actors, (c) outputs, and (d) dynamics. This process was followed by organizing the findings and interpreting them within the tetradic framework to develop a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of the online design studio. Overall, this research aims to provide a detailed and nuanced analysis of the impact of online studio education on design studio pedagogy, conceptualizing McLuhan’s tetrad as a basis for the analysis, and therefore aiming to enrich our understanding of the post-COVID-19 era of learning architecture by examining the dramatic change in the medium and its effects.","architecture education, design studio pedagogy, online design studio education, tetradic analysis, post‑COVID‑19",Semantic Scholar,https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f87de4d5f9eb710111e76bba18ccdf0ab0118c49,11/9/2025,"""studio pedagogy"" AND ""digital design""",Turkey,

83,274214273,"Enriching STEAM education with visual art: education benefits, teaching examples, and trends","Chengxin Zhang, Bochen Jia",Discover Education,2024,"In the contemporary recent education landscape, an inventive paradigm known as ‘‘STEAM’’ has emerged, which augments the erstwhile STEM framework by incorporating the dimension of ‘‘Art’’. STEAM endeavors to enhance students' capacities for creativity, innovation, and design thinking. Among the various forms of artistic expression, the visual arts, as the earliest form of human expression, play a pivotal role within and beyond the boundaries of the arts, which gives visual arts-based STEAM (VA-STEAM) fundamentally advantageous and potential to enhance student learning in STEM fields. However, many explorers have encountered challenges when embarking upon or sustaining their involvement in VA-STEAM initiatives, primarily stemming from constraints such as an insufficiency of clear instruction, dedicated resources, requisite materials, or adequate temporal provisions for planning and preparation. This paper aims to understand the existing approaches of applying visual art into STEM dominated education system and explore the feasible and efficient way to integrate visual art into current STEM system. This paper aims to understand the existing approaches of applying visual art into STEM dominated education system and explore the feasible and efficient way to integrate visual art into current STEM system through a comprehensive literature review. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current status of VA-STEAM to the explorers and interested parties in the related fields, the present literature review delves into the manifold benefits inherent to the existing domain of VA-STEAM education, elucidated illustrative pedagogical instances categorized by subject matter, and delineated prevailing trajectories within the educational landscape pertaining to this domain. 57 articles were identified, from which 49 papers were deeply studied and summarized. Prior research has indicated that the integration of VA-STEAM education holds the potential to yield a spectrum of benefits for students, encompassing improvements in memory retention, facilitation of causal reasoning skills, utilization as a pedagogical tool and resource, cultivation of nuanced artistic cognitive faculties encompassing observation, description, association, and comparison, as well as the enhancement of critical thinking capacities spanning observation, allocation, interpretation, and analysis. Moreover, VA-STEAM facilitates the application of multidisciplinary knowledge and creative thinking in the execution of design-based projects (DBP) or problem-based learning projects (PBL). To better assist teachers in implementing VA-STEAM, this paper summarized existing VA-STEAM teaching examples and multidisciplinary contents by subjects, including related projects or ideas for math & geometry, physical, biology, chemistry, and history classes. Notably, visual art serves as a conduit to express and evaluate STEM concepts, affording students the flexible means to visually depict and communicate complex concepts and ideas that elude verbal articulation. In the interest of supporting educators in the successful integration of VA-STEAM, this study also synthesizes extant teaching instances and interdisciplinary content across subjects, encompassing pertinent projects and concepts tailored to mathematics and geometry, physical sciences, biology, chemistry, and history disciplines. Visual art can be a great entry point to integrate art into STEM curriculums, it can provide a variety of benefits for different subjects. The current trajectory of VA-STEAM initiatives encompasses several key dimensions: (1) the strategic utilization of visual art as a mechanism for facilitating the visualization, exploration, and comprehension of STEM disciplines; (2) the integration of DBP and PBL that foster cross-disciplinary engagement and promote inquiry-driven educational experiences; and (3) the formulation of symbiotic programs characterized by mutual enhancement of STEM and art learning paradigms, yielding optimal outcomes for both domains.","Creativity and Arts Education, Engineering and Technology Education, Mathematical Teaching Educational Skills, Professional and Vocational Education, Technology and Design education",Semantic Scholar,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44217-024-00354-w,11/11/2025,"""design thinking"" AND ""art education""",United States,
