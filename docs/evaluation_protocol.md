# Evaluation Plan

1. Choose 15 test queries (e.g., "studio pedagogy", "digital creativity", "collaborative design").
2. For each query:
   - Run it in the system once built.
   - Mark retrieved abstracts as relevant (1) or not relevant (0).
3. Compute Precision and Recall:
   Precision = relevant / retrieved
   Recall = relevant / total_relevant
4. Write a short paragraph about interpretive usefulness of the visualizations.
